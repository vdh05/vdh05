# Hi there, I'm Vidhi Harwani! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating beautiful and functional web applications. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from small experiments to full-fledged web applications.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at Charotar University of Science and Technology, Anand. My journey in web development began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've since expanded my skills to include frameworks like React.js and backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.
